# regularized

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This repository contains basic implementations of several regularisation methods. 
Currently they are only for regression (from a GLM point of view the link function is identity).
There is an implementation of elasticnet (with ridge and lasso as special cases), 
and mcp. Furthermore, the implementation tries to be fairly straight-forward and 
demonstrative. Thus simple coordinate descent has been implemented, without 
heavy optimisation (though those are intended in the future).
