## regularized


This repository is an attempt at a simple implementation of several regularisation methods. 

Notably these include lasso, elasticnet (of which lasso is technically a special case), 
MCP (minimax concave penalty) and SCAD (smoothly clipped absolute deviations). 

Adaptive lasso and relaxed lasso will also be considered eventually.
